**Splitter** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Justin Ralph**

Time spent: **16** hours (and counting!) spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] The above **optional** features
- [ ] User-defined custom themes
- [ ] UI reformatting for iPad/other device deployment
- [ ] Landscape support
- [x] Split the bill based on party size
- [x] Add a slider for a custom tip amount
- [x] Add a settings page
- [ ] Populate the settings page

## Notes
The main objectives moving forward are to implement the unchecked features and improve the UI. 

The next hurdle is passing information inputted in the settings page back to the main page and saving the information for subsequent launches.
